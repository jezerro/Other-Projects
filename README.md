Projects that i've lost the source

In this repository i will post every other project i've done and either lost the source or is of different nature. Projects abandoned in very early stages (mostly Unity) are not included. In here you will find:

• The forest - An amazing [scene](https://github.com/Mistral-Designs/Other-Projects/blob/master/forest.rar) made in Unity. You can walk around. And admire.

• The Coins Game - A game i made for a friendly studio, each tap produces coins, coins merged at hundreds producing a higher value coin and unlocking bonuses. Mainly an economics project if you ask me. Harder than it sounds.
